Learn how to create a fully functional CRUD API for a to-do app using Express.js and MongoDB. This step-by-step guide covers project setup, coding, and detailed explanations of how each component works.

In this codelab, we’ll walk you through building a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API for a to-do app using **Express.js** and **MongoDB**. This tutorial starts with setting up the project and installing the necessary dependencies. You'll learn how to define and implement a **Mongoose schema** for your tasks, write routes to handle API operations, and connect the application to a local MongoDB database.

Each part of the code is explained with "What it does" and "Why" sections, helping you understand both the functionality and the purpose of each component. You’ll also learn how to handle common features like filtering, validation, and updating task statuses.

By the end of the tutorial, you’ll have a robust backend system capable of managing tasks efficiently. Whether you’re a beginner or looking to solidify your understanding of CRUD operations, this guide will equip you with the skills to build more complex web applications in the future.
